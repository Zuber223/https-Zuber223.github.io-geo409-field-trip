### **Data Sources**
The analysis was conducted using GIS datasets, including:

- **Land Cover Data**: Extracted from remote sensing sources and state GIS databases.
- **Canopy Model Data**: Derived from LiDAR and aerial imagery.
- **Base Layers**: County boundaries, road networks, and elevation data.

These maps are designed for use in **Avenza Maps** to assist field trip participants in geolocating their observations.
